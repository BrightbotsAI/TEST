Maximo utilizes a series of applications, within modules, to setup and maintain an organization‚Äôs asset management plan. When using the Go To menu to navigate to these applications, the list in the drop-down menu is the list of modules. The menu expands to show the applications within each module. In some instances, there are categories of applications, so an additional list level is between the module name and application name.

When using the Go To menu to navigate to these applications, the list in the drop-down menu is the list of modules. The menu expands to show the applications within each module. In some instances, there are categories of applications, so an additional list level is between the module name and application name.

System - A method for organizing different types of locations and assets in the same database to allow for different asset tracking processes. For example, the HVAC system of vents, air conditioners, and heaters within a building is separate from the IT Networking system of cables, switches, routers, and computers within a building.  Location - A physical, geographic location where assets reside, or a virtual space, either from which assets can be transferred in and out. A location can also be a labor record, as in the person that the handheld or laptop is assigned to.  Asset - A physical piece of equipment that needs to be managed and maintained via the asset management process.  Item - A physical piece of equipment that needs to be managed via the inventory process. An inventory item may also be an asset. This is a rotating item.  Classification - A method for organizing assets with the same components or parts.  Specification - The specific values of the components or parts of an asset.

You can specify a job plan, safety plan, failure class, scheduling information, and planned labor, materials, tools, and services. If you specify a job plan or job task that is related to an inspection form, that inspection form is automatically added to the Inspection Form field. 5-Save the work order. Note: An asterisk (*) indicates a required field  Several applications in Maximo can be used to create work orders depending on business process and permissions. - Work Order Tracking - Use to create and report on high-volume or complex work orders. - Changes - Use to create work orders related to service desk tickets. - Condition Monitoring - Use to generate work orders to correct problem conditions found during monitoring procedures. - Incidents - Use to create work orders related to service desk tickets - Preventive Maintenance - Use to generate scheduled maintenance work orders. - Problems - Use to create work orders related to service desk tickets. - Quick Reporting - Use to create work orders and report actual work done for simple jobs, unplanned work, or work not performed by the maintenance department. - Releases - Use to create work orders related to service desk tickets. - Service Requests - Use to create work orders related to service desk tickets.

If you have specified a GL account, when work orders are generated from the PM record, the system takes any unspecified segments from the associated location and or asset. Optional: Build a PM for the assets on a route. In the Route field, specify a value. Fill the remaining required fields as appropriate.

Clear this check box if you want the next work order due date to be based on the average metered usage.  Generate Work Order When Meter Frequency is Reached Select this check box if you want work orders for this PM to be automatically generated when the meter frequency has been reached and entered. This check box can only be selected if the Generate WO Based on Meter Reading (Do Not Estimate) check box has been selected.  Define the frequency with which you want the PM to generate work orders. The PM frequency can be time-based, meter-based, or both. For time-based master PMs, define the frequency criteria as wanted. For meter-based master PMs, define the frequency criteria as wanted. If the PM is a seasonal PM, define the days/dates that you want the PM to be active on the Seasonal Dates tab. On the Job Plan Sequence tab, enter job plan data for the PM. If the PM is the parent record in a PM hierarchy, define the child PMs on the PM Hierarchy tab. Click Save PM.

WSCH The work order is waiting to be scheduled. WSCH is the default status for work orders that are created in the Preventive Maintenance application. WMATL Materials must arrive before the work can be performed. WPCOND The work can be performed only when the condition of the plant is suitable. For example, certain work might require that the plant is shut down. INPRG The work is in progress. INPRG is the default status for work orders that are created in the Quick Reporting application. COMP The physical work is completed. CLOSE The work order is closed. Inventory reservations for items that were not used for the work listed on the work order are removed, and the work order becomes a history record. CAN The work order is canceled. You cannot cancel a work order if the work is already in progress or if actuals are already reported. HISTEDIT The work order was edited in history.

You can specify a job plan, safety plan, failure class, scheduling information, and planned labor, materials, tools, and services. If you specify a job plan or job task that is related to an inspection form, that inspection form is automatically added to the Inspection Form field. 5-Save the work order. Note: An asterisk (*) indicates a required field  Several applications in Maximo can be used to create work orders depending on business process and permissions. - Work Order Tracking - Use to create and report on high-volume or complex work orders. - Changes - Use to create work orders related to service desk tickets. - Condition Monitoring - Use to generate work orders to correct problem conditions found during monitoring procedures. - Incidents - Use to create work orders related to service desk tickets - Preventive Maintenance - Use to generate scheduled maintenance work orders. - Problems - Use to create work orders related to service desk tickets. - Quick Reporting - Use to create work orders and report actual work done for simple jobs, unplanned work, or work not performed by the maintenance department. - Releases - Use to create work orders related to service desk tickets. - Service Requests - Use to create work orders related to service desk tickets.
